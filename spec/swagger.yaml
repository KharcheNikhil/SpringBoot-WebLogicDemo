    description: >-
      This API is documented in **OpenAPI format** and is based on [Pestore
      sample](http://petstore.swagger.io/) provided by
      [swagger.io](http://swagger.io) team. It was **extended** to illustrate
      features of
      [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo)
      tool and [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) documentation. In
      addition to standard OpenAPI syntax we use a few [vendor
      extensions](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).
  - name: OpenAPI Specification
    description: >-
      The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard,
      language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and
      computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service
      without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic
      inspection. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand
      and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of
      implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level
      programming, OpenAPI removes the guesswork in calling the service.

  - name: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
    description: >
      This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in
      compliance with  [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).

      And that allows cross-domain communication from the browser.

      All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely
      public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.
